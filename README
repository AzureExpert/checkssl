With the good work by "Letâ€™s Encrypt" in providing free SSL certs for users, I wanted a quick way to check all the domains I look after to determine which ones have correct SSL certs, and which ones are in need of updating etc. 

This bash file is the first draft a a program to do that.  It can either be run against a list of file names, from the directories in your Lets Encrypt live directory or on a single server with  the aim of getting all the domain names from the server.   

The output looks like:

Domain       cert issued for    valid until               cert issued by                possible issues?
domain1.com  domain1.com        Dec 22 09:19:00 2016 GMT  Let's Encrypt Authority X1  - certificate near renewal date
domain2.com  domain2.com (alt)  Dec 22 11:42:00 2016 GMT  Let's Encrypt Authority X1  - certificate near renewal date
domain3.net  domain3.net        Mar  4 10:10:00 2016 GMT  Let's Encrypt Authority X1
